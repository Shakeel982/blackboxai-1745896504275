# AI Video to 3D Animated Video Application - Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to create an AI application that takes long videos (up to 2 hours) as input and automatically transforms them into smooth, high-quality 3D animated videos. The application will detect scenes and objects frame-by-frame, convert 2D frames into 3D geometry with realistic depth estimation, apply user-selectable cartoonish or cinematic 3D animation styles, maintain character movements, backgrounds, and camera transitions, support batch processing for long videos, and output final videos in 1080p or 4K resolution.

## Features
- Scene and object detection using deep learning models.
- 3D geometry reconstruction from 2D frames with depth estimation.
- Stylized 3D animation with options: Pixar style, Anime, Realistic 3D, Claymation.
- Preservation of character movements, backgrounds, and camera transitions.
- Batch processing for long videos without lag.
- Output video in 1080p or 4K resolution.

## Suggested Tools and Libraries
- Video processing: OpenCV
- Deep learning frameworks: PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Pose estimation: OpenPose, MediaPipe, or similar
- Depth estimation: MiDaS or similar pretrained models
- 3D rendering and animation: Blender (via Python API) or Open3D for prototyping
- Stylization: Neural style transfer models or custom cartoonization filters
- Video encoding: FFmpeg or OpenCV VideoWriter

## Detailed Component Plan

### 1. Video Processing
- Extract frames from input video using OpenCV.
- Detect scene changes and segment video accordingly.
- Store frames for further processing.

### 2. Scene and Object Detection
- Use pretrained object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to detect objects per frame.
- Track objects across frames to maintain continuity.

### 3. 3D Pose and Depth Estimation
- Use 3D pose estimation models to estimate human/character poses.
- Use depth estimation models (e.g., MiDaS) to predict depth maps for frames.
- Combine pose and depth data to reconstruct 3D geometry.

### 4. Animation and Stylization
- Use Blender's Python API or Open3D to create 3D animated scenes.
- Apply user-selectable animation styles (Pixar, Anime, Realistic 3D, Claymation) using style transfer or custom shaders.
- Maintain smooth character movements, backgrounds, and camera transitions.

### 5. Batch Processing
- Process video in chunks to handle long videos efficiently.
- Use multiprocessing or asynchronous processing to avoid lag.

### 6. Output Generation
- Render final animated video in 1080p or 4K.
- Use FFmpeg or OpenCV VideoWriter for encoding.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Blender (for rendering, optional but recommended)
- FFmpeg
- Pretrained models for pose and depth estimation
- Additional libraries: NumPy, SciPy, moviepy, etc.

## Follow-up Steps
- Setup development environment and install dependencies.
- Implement video processing and frame extraction.
- Integrate pose and depth estimation models.
- Develop 3D animation and stylization modules.
- Implement batch processing.
- Test with sample videos and optimize performance.
- Add user interface or CLI for style selection and processing control.
