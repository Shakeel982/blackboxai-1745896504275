# AI Video to 3D Animated Video Application

## Project Overview
The AI Video to 3D Animated Video Application is designed to automatically transform long videos (up to 2 hours) into smooth, high-quality 3D animated content. Utilizing advanced deep learning models, the application detects scenes and objects in the video, reconstructs 3D geometry from 2D frames, and applies various animation styles including Pixar, Anime, Realistic 3D, and Claymation. The application supports batch processing for lengthy videos and can output final animations in 1080p or 4K resolution.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed:
   - OpenCV
   - Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow)
   - Blender (for rendering, optional but recommended)
   - FFmpeg

## Usage
To run the application:

1. Prepare your input video(s) by placing them in the `data/` directory.
2. Adjust settings in `src/main.py` to select the desired animation style and options.
3. Execute the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py --input video_filename.mp4 --output output_filename.mp4 --style <chosen_style>
   ```

   Replace `<chosen_style>` with your desired animation style (e.g., "Pixar", "Anime").

## Features
- **Scene and Object Detection**: Detects and segments scenes using advanced deep learning models.
- **3D Geometry Reconstruction**: Converts 2D frames into 3D geometry with depth estimation.
- **Stylized 3D Animation**: Allows for multiple animation styles, including Pixar, Anime, Realistic 3D, and Claymation.
- **Preservation of Movements**: Maintains character movements, backgrounds, and camera transitions.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles long videos without performance lag.
- **High-Resolution Outputs**: Supports video output in 1080p or 4K resolution.

## Dependencies
